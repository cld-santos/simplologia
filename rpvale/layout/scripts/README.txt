
Both of the following files have been named as such because of "ease of use"

jquery-latest.min.js
jquery-ui.min.js

These files are used as a back-up, as we link to the original files on the jQuery CDN network.
If for some reason the CDN has problems and files can't be loaded, the backups are loaded.


If you want to update the files to ensure they are the latest versions simply follow these instructions:


for the jquery-latest.min.js => http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js

Download the file and use it to overwrite the original file, remember to ensure the file name is exactly the same as the original file


for the jquery-ui.min.js => http://jqueryui.com/download/

When downloading the jQuery UI - don't select a theme - select "No Theme"

Once you have downloaded the zip file, unpack it and open the "js" folder, find the file that has ".custom.min.js" in its file name.

Open the original "jquery-ui.min.js", delete the contents and paste the content from the new file into it and save it.

OR

Rename the new file to "jquery-ui.min.js" and simply overwite the old file with the new one.
